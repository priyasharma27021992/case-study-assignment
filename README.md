## Linting, Testing, Prettier

## Note

\*\*I am making an angular project for the first time for this project so I feel there are many ways it could be improved.

1. More tests can be added. I was adding test for dashboard and service but was stuck at a place due to a router error from angular
2. I tried making packages from different components but if the application is bigger we can have shared components
3. yarn could be used over npm due to various benefits over npm
4. ng-grid could be customised more as per the need
5. the service can be added with controller and models
