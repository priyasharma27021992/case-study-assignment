### How to run on local

Run `npm i` to install node_modules AND `npm run start` to run. Check scripts to check more commands

## External packages used

1. `ag-grid` for the data table
2. `tailwind` for quick css
3. `eslint` for linting
4. `prettier` for formatting

## Building Packages

To build all applications and packages, execute the following commands at the repository root:

```
    npm run build
```

## Linting, Testing, Prettier

Here are some available commands:

```
    npm run lint
    npm run test
```

## Note

\*\*I am making an angular project for the first time for this assignment so I feel there are many ways it could be improved.

1. More tests can be added for sure. I was adding test service but was stuck at a place
2. I tried making packages from different components but if the application is bigger we can have shared components
3. yarn could be used over npm due to various benefits over npm
4. ng-grid could be customised more as per the need
5. the service can be added with controller and models
